# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

This is the result of my learning from Udacity's Fundamentals of Web Development. This project combines knowledge of HTML, CSS, ECMAScript and jQuery which, put together, produce a classic memory game on a modern platform, be it a smartphone, a tablet or a desktop.

## Instructions

The goal of the game is to match cards with their correspondent ones, that is, with the one card with the same image. The less moves you take, the better and the higher your star rate will be. Good luck!
